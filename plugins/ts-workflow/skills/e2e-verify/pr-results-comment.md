# Step 6: Post E2E Results as PR Comment

## 6a. Build Comment Body

Construct a structured markdown comment using the results from Steps 1-5:

```markdown
## E2E Verification Results

**Mode:** $MODE
**Branch:** $BRANCH (rebased onto $BASE_BRANCH)
**Commit:** $HEAD_SHA

### Build Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Code generation | $GEN_RESULT (pass/fail/skipped) |
| Build (`$PM run build`) | $BUILD_RESULT (pass/fail/skipped) |
| Type check (`$PM run type-check` / `tsc --noEmit`) | $TYPECHECK_RESULT (pass/fail/skipped) |
| Tests (`$PM run test`) | $TEST_RESULT (pass/fail/skipped) |
| Lint (`$PM run lint`) | $LINT_RESULT (pass/fail/skipped) |

*A check is `skipped` only when the repo declares no such script and no
fallback applies. Name the concrete command that ran, not the placeholder.*

### E2E Visual Verification Results

| Route | Visual Status | Spec Match | Console Errors | Network Errors |
|-------|--------------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| / | Rendered correctly | Yes — matches spec | None | None |
| /dashboard | Layout issue | No — missing sidebar | None | None |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Pages tested:** $PAGES_TESTED

*Count spec matches and discrepancies from the Visual Verification Findings below.*

### Visual Verification Findings

For each page tested, include a detailed description of what was visually observed and how it compares to the spec:

**Route: /**
- **Expected (from spec):** Homepage with hero section, navigation bar, and feature cards
- **Observed:** Hero section renders with correct heading and CTA button. Navigation bar shows all 4 links. Feature cards display in a 3-column grid. All images loaded.
- **Verdict:** PASS — matches spec

**Route: /dashboard**
- **Expected (from spec):** User dashboard with sidebar navigation and data table
- **Observed:** Data table renders correctly with 3 columns. However, sidebar navigation is missing — only the main content area is visible. The layout appears to be full-width instead of the expected sidebar + content split.
- **Verdict:** FAIL — sidebar navigation missing from layout

*Each route MUST include Expected / Observed / Verdict. Invalid Observed
entries: "Screenshot captured", "looks good", "no console errors", or any other
DOM-only check. The Observed field must describe what the screenshot actually
shows. A screenshot of a QR code covering text means Verdict=FAIL — set
`E2E_RESULT='fail'` and stop.*

### Screenshots

| Page | Screenshot |
|------|-----------|
| / | ![homepage](screenshot-homepage.png) |
| /dashboard | ![dashboard](screenshot-dashboard.png) |

*Screenshots saved locally. See Visual Verification Findings above for what was observed in each screenshot.*

### Edge Cases Tested

| Case | Expected | Observed | Result |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Empty list view | Shows "no items" message | "No items found" text centered in empty table body | PASS |
| Invalid form input | Shows validation error | Red border on email field, "Invalid email" message below | PASS |

*Edge case section only appears if edge cases were tested in Step 5i.*
*The "Observed" column MUST describe what was actually seen in the screenshot, not just "Rendered correctly".*

### Verification Outcome

**E2E_RESULT:** `$E2E_RESULT`

Allowed values: `pass`, `fail`, `partial`, `skipped`, `skipped-server-failed`,
`missing-browser-tooling`, `uninspected-screenshots`.

**Gate (per `SKILL.md` Step 7):**
- UI-visible diff → only `pass` proceeds. Any other value blocks shipping:
  no `run-full-ci` label, no `e2e-verified` label, no `$ts-workflow:ship`.
- Non-UI diff → `skipped` is the success path.

If this section reports anything other than `pass` (UI-visible) or `skipped`
(non-UI), the workflow has stopped. Address the findings above and re-run
`$ts-workflow:e2e-verify`.

### Summary

$OVERALL_VERDICT
```

The Verification Outcome section is **required for every comment**, regardless
of mode. It makes the gate visible to humans reading the PR.

**Conditional sections:**
- If a Playwright suite ran (per `e2e-test-execution.md` §5e.1): add a
  `### Playwright Suite` section with the pass/fail counts and the names of any
  failing specs. It supplements — never replaces — the Visual Verification
  Findings.
- If E2E was skipped because there are no web components: replace the E2E Visual Verification Results section with: `*E2E tests skipped: $SKIP_REASON*`
- If E2E was blocked by unavailable or failed MCP tooling: replace the E2E Visual Verification Results section with: `*E2E tests blocked: missing browser tooling. Pages tested: $PAGES_TESTED.*`
- If build failed: add a prominent warning at the top: `> **Build failed — E2E tests were not run.**`
- If investigate mode: add an "Investigation Findings" section with gap analysis

**Quality gate for the comment:** Before posting, verify that:
- Every tested route has Expected/Observed/Verdict entries (not just "captured" or "pass")
- The Observed column contains actual visual descriptions (what elements were seen, their layout, their content)
- Any discrepancies between Expected and Observed are called out clearly

## 6b. Post Comment

```bash
gh pr comment "$PR_NUM" --repo "$REPO_SLUG" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<constructed comment body>
EOF
)"
```

## 6c. Mode-Specific Footer

The footer depends on `E2E_RESULT`. Pass-path footers per mode below; fail-path
is identical across modes.

**Pass path** (`E2E_RESULT=pass` for UI-visible, or `E2E_RESULT=skipped` for non-UI):

| Mode | Footer |
|------|--------|
| `verify` | "Verification complete. Ready for review." |
| `fix-and-verify` | "Review feedback addressed and verified. `run-full-ci` label added." |
| `investigate` | "Investigation complete. See findings above." |
| `ship-prep` | "Ship prep complete. `run-full-ci` label added. Ready for `$ts-workflow:ship`." |
| `ship` | "Verified and shipping via `$ts-workflow:ship`." |
| `fix-and-ship` | "Review addressed, verified, and shipping. `run-full-ci` label added." |

**Fail path** (`E2E_RESULT` is `fail`, `partial`, `skipped-server-failed`,
`missing-browser-tooling`, or `uninspected-screenshots` on a UI-visible diff)
— same footer for every mode:

> E2E verification failed (`$E2E_RESULT`). Workflow stopped — no labels added,
> no ship invoked. Address the findings above and re-run
> `$ts-workflow:e2e-verify`.

## 6d. Add Labels (gated on `E2E_RESULT`)

Labels are added only when the Step 7 gate would pass — i.e. `E2E_RESULT=pass`
on a UI-visible diff or `E2E_RESULT=skipped` on a non-UI diff. For any fail
state, **do not add `run-full-ci`** and **do not add `e2e-verified`**.

When the gate has passed, for modes that add the `run-full-ci` label
(`fix-and-verify`, `ship-prep`, `fix-and-ship`):

```bash
jq -cn '{labels: ["run-full-ci"]}' |
  gh api --method POST "repos/$REPO_SLUG/issues/$PR_NUM/labels" --input -
```

When the gate has passed, also add the `e2e-verified` label to mark the PR as
E2E-clean:

```bash
jq -cn '{labels: ["e2e-verified"]}' |
  gh api --method POST "repos/$REPO_SLUG/issues/$PR_NUM/labels" --input -
```

Both labels must already exist in the repository. A failed REST label request
is a non-success result; do not report the corresponding label as added.
