name: tmux-start
description: "Start issue work in a new tmux window with its own worktree. Use when the user has tmux running and wants issue startup to continue outside the current session. SKIP when not inside a tmux session ($TMUX unset) or when the user wants to work in the current session; use start-issue directly."

# Start Issue in tmux Window

Before requesting decisions, read
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/driver-interaction.md` and follow its
cross-platform capability-binding rules.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/decision-gates.md` before resolving target or
secret-copy intent.

## Empty Arguments

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not provided, explain:

This skill creates or reuses a worktree, opens a new tmux window, launches
Claude Code, and sends `/ts-workflow:start-issue` automatically.

**Claude Code:** `/ts-workflow:tmux-start <issue-number>`.

**Codex:** `$ts-workflow:tmux-start <issue-number>`.

**Prerequisites:** running inside a tmux session (`$TMUX` set); `gh`
authenticated; inside a git repo.

This is a **missing-intent gate**. Request: "What issue number should I start in
a tmux window?" If structured input is unavailable, ask in the final response
and stop before creating a worktree or tmux window.

---

## Clear Worktree State

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree-state.sh" clear 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Issue Number

Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the issue number. The script validates that it is numeric
and that the issue exists.

## Environment Files

Check whether the source repo has environment files before creating the
worktree:

```bash
SOURCE_DIR="$(pwd)"
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree-create.sh" env-files --source-dir "$SOURCE_DIR"
```

If the output starts with `ENV_FILES_FOUND=true`, follow the shared
**missing-intent gate**. Request explicit consent: "Found environment files
that may contain secrets. Copy them to the new worktree?" Stop before worktree
or tmux creation when structured input is unavailable.

## Start tmux Workflow

If copying environment files was explicitly authorized:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tmux-start.sh" "$ARGUMENTS" --copy-env
```

Otherwise:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tmux-start.sh" "$ARGUMENTS" --no-copy-env
```

The script validates prerequisites, creates or reuses the standard issue
worktree, registers worktree state, opens or switches to the issue tmux window,
launches Claude Code, waits for a prompt or stable launch marker, and sends
`/ts-workflow:start-issue <issue-number>`.

Set `TS_WORKFLOW_TMUX_CLAUDE_CMD` before invocation to override the default
Claude launch command (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`).
