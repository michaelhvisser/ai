# Address PR Review Comments

Before requesting decisions or delegating work, read
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/driver-interaction.md` and follow its
cross-platform capability-binding rules.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/decision-gates.md` before resolving any workflow
choice.

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/github-rest.sh"
```

## Output Durability

Replies to review comments and any new commit messages describe what behavior changed and why, not file paths or line numbers. A reviewer reading the reply six months later, after the file in question has moved, must still understand what was fixed.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not provided:**

Auto-detect PR from current branch:

```bash
CURRENT_CHECKOUT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
WORKTREE_PATH="$CURRENT_CHECKOUT_ROOT"
CURRENT_PR_JSON=$(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && github_current_pr 2>/dev/null) || true
jq -r '.number' <<< "$CURRENT_PR_JSON" 2>/dev/null
```

If no PR is found, display usage:

**Claude Code:** `/ts-workflow:address-review [PR-number] [--no-watch]`

**Codex:** `$ts-workflow:address-review [PR-number] [--no-watch]`

**Example:** `/address-review 123` or just `/address-review` on a PR branch. Add `--no-watch` to exit after one fix cycle instead of watching for bot re-reviews.

This is a **missing-intent gate**. Request: "No PR was found for the current
branch. What PR number should I address?" If structured input is unavailable,
ask in the final response and stop before loop initialization or a completion
claim.

---

**If PR number is available (from `$ARGUMENTS` or auto-detected):**

## Parse Arguments

```bash
WATCH_MODE=true
PR_ARG=""
for arg in $ARGUMENTS; do
  case "$arg" in
    --no-watch) WATCH_MODE=false ;;
    *) PR_ARG="$arg" ;;
  esac
done
echo "WATCH_MODE=$WATCH_MODE PR_ARG=$PR_ARG"
```

## Security Validation

!if [ -n "$PR_ARG" ] && ! echo "$PR_ARG" | grep -qE '^[0-9]+$'; then echo "Error: PR number must be numeric"; exit 1; fi

## Resolve PR Number

```bash
CURRENT_CHECKOUT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT=$(git -C "$CURRENT_CHECKOUT_ROOT" worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree / {sub(/^worktree /, ""); print; exit}')
WORKTREE_PATH="${WORKTREE_PATH:-$CURRENT_CHECKOUT_ROOT}"
if [ -z "$ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT" ] || [ "${ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT#/}" = "$ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT" ] ||
   [ -z "$WORKTREE_PATH" ] || [ "${WORKTREE_PATH#/}" = "$WORKTREE_PATH" ] || [ ! -d "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Could not resolve absolute repository paths."
  exit 1
fi
CURRENT_REPO_SLUG=$(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}" --jq '.full_name')
REPO_SLUG="${REPO_SLUG:-$CURRENT_REPO_SLUG}"
if [ -n "$PR_ARG" ]; then
  RESOLVED_PR="$PR_ARG"
elif CURRENT_PR_JSON=$(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && github_current_pr 2>/dev/null); then
  RESOLVED_PR=$(jq -er '.number' <<< "$CURRENT_PR_JSON")
else
  RESOLVED_PR="auto"
fi
PR_NUM="$RESOLVED_PR"
echo "Resolved PR: $RESOLVED_PR"
```

## Embedded Workflow Contract

Address-review is embedded only when both caller variables are explicitly set.
Never infer composition from a generic inherited `STATE_FILE`:

```bash
EMBEDDED_WORKFLOW=false
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/loop-state.sh"
RESOLVED_ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT=$(git -C "$CURRENT_CHECKOUT_ROOT" worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree / { sub(/^worktree /, ""); print; exit }')
if [ -z "$RESOLVED_ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT" ] || [ "${RESOLVED_ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT#/}" = "$RESOLVED_ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT" ] || [ ! -d "$RESOLVED_ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT" ]; then
  echo "Error: Could not resolve the absolute primary worktree root."
  exit 1
fi
if [ -n "${CALLER_LOOP_STATE_FILE:-}" ] && [ -n "${CALLER_WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH:-}" ]; then
  EMBEDDED_WORKFLOW=true
  STATE_FILE="$CALLER_LOOP_STATE_FILE"
  WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH=$(child_workflow_path "$CALLER_WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH" "address_review")
  initialize_workflow_state "$STATE_FILE" "$WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH"
  ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT=$(get_loop_field "$STATE_FILE" "original_repo_root" '[]')
  WORKTREE_PATH=$(get_loop_field "$STATE_FILE" "worktree_path" '[]')
  REPO_SLUG=$(get_loop_field "$STATE_FILE" "repo_slug" '[]')
elif [ -n "${CALLER_LOOP_STATE_FILE:-}" ] || [ -n "${CALLER_WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH:-}" ]; then
  echo "Error: Embedded address-review requires both caller state variables."
  exit 1
else
  ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT="$RESOLVED_ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT"
  WORKTREE_PATH="$CURRENT_CHECKOUT_ROOT"
  REPO_SLUG=$(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}" --jq '.full_name')
  STATE_FILE="$ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT/.local/state/address-review-${RESOLVED_PR:-auto}.loop.local.json"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$STATE_FILE")"
  STATE_FILE=$(cd "$(dirname "$STATE_FILE")" && pwd)/$(basename "$STATE_FILE")
  WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH='[]'
fi

LOOP_STATE_FILE="$STATE_FILE"
```

When embedded, every phase and field operation uses `STATE_FILE` plus
`WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH`. Address-review never changes the root completion promise
or terminal allowlist, never initializes another loop, and returns only through
`set_workflow_result "$STATE_FILE" "$WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH" RESULT REASON PHASE`.

## Loop Initialization & Re-entry

Read `loop-management.md` for loop setup and phase re-entry logic. Key behavior:
- If resuming `watching` phase in watch mode → skip to Step 12 (watch loop)
- If resuming `watching` phase in no-watch mode → clear phase, run full fix cycle
- Otherwise → continue normally

## Hard Invariant Failure

When this skill or a supporting file reports
`WORKFLOW_RESULT=INCOMPLETE`, persist the supplied reason:

```bash
INVARIANT_STATE_FILE="${STATE_FILE:-${LOOP_STATE_FILE:-}}"
if [ -z "$INVARIANT_STATE_FILE" ] || [ ! -f "$INVARIANT_STATE_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Error: Cannot persist address-review invariant failure without loop state."
  exit 1
fi
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/loop-state.sh"
if [ "$EMBEDDED_WORKFLOW" = "true" ]; then
  set_workflow_result "$STATE_FILE" "$WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH" "incomplete" "$WORKFLOW_REASON" "incomplete"
  echo "ADDRESS_REVIEW_RESULT=incomplete"
  echo "ADDRESS_REVIEW_REASON=$WORKFLOW_REASON"
else
  set_loop_terminal_result "$STATE_FILE" "incomplete" "$WORKFLOW_REASON" "incomplete" "INCOMPLETE"
  echo "<done>INCOMPLETE</done>"
fi
```

Stop after this block. Never fetch feedback, edit files, push, or claim
completion from an invariant-failure path. The embedded branch returns the
structured incomplete state and emits no terminal marker.

## Context & Bot Discovery

Read `setup-and-discovery.md` for REST PR context gathering, mode banner display, and bot discovery from REST formal reviews plus GraphQL review threads. Match discovered authors against `bot-registry.md`.
Store the matched bot logins in `DETECTED_BOTS`; leave it empty when the
registry match finds none.

---

## Step 1: Checkout PR Branch and Rebase

Read `checkout-rebase.md` for the full procedure: fetch and checkout the REST-declared PR head without overwriting local work, preserve fork/base metadata, check if behind, rebase + force-push if needed, and wait for CI after rebase.

## Step 2: Fetch All Review Feedback

Read `fetch-feedback.md` for GraphQL review threads (line-specific, auto-resolvable) and REST formal reviews (CHANGES_REQUESTED).

## Steps 3-9: Fix Cycle

Read `fix-cycle.md` for the complete fix cycle:
- **Step 3:** Categorize comments into Group A (resolvable threads) and Group B (pending reviews)
- **Clean-review path:** Set `REVIEW_CLEAN=true`, persist `review_clean=true` to the active state, skip inapplicable mutation work, and continue through local verification, CI, and Step 11
- **Step 4:** Address each comment — parallel dispatch for 3+ comments on different files, sequential otherwise. Understand request, locate code, make minimal fix, validate against feedback
- **Step 4.5:** Generate tests for testable fixes (read `test-generation.md`)
- **Step 5:** Verify locally — worktree-scoped build, type-check, test, and lint through the repo's detected package manager (`fix-cycle.md` carries the detection block and command table)
- **Step 6:** Commit and push, capture `BOT_REVIEW_BASELINE` timestamp
- **Step 7:** Watch CI — retry up to 3x if no checks reported
- **Step 8:** Reply to each comment
- **Step 9:** Resolve review threads via GraphQL (Group A only)

## Step 10: Request Re-review

Read `bot-registry.md` for the full re-review procedure (Steps 10a-10e) including bot detection, opt-out checks, and data-driven re-review triggering.

## Step 11: Verify Completion

Confirm all resolvable threads are resolved and CI is passing:

```bash
PR_JSON=$(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && github_pr "$PR_NUM") || {
  WORKFLOW_RESULT=INCOMPLETE
  WORKFLOW_REASON=pr-metadata-api-failure
}
if [ -z "${WORKFLOW_REASON:-}" ]; then
  PR_HEAD_SHA=$(jq -er '.head.sha' <<< "$PR_JSON") || {
    WORKFLOW_RESULT=INCOMPLETE
    WORKFLOW_REASON=invalid-pr-metadata
  }
fi
if [ -z "${WORKFLOW_REASON:-}" ]; then
  REVIEW_HEAD_EXPECTATION="${EXPECTED_REVIEW_HEAD:-$(git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" rev-parse HEAD)}"
fi
if [ -z "${WORKFLOW_REASON:-}" ] &&
   [ "$PR_HEAD_SHA" != "$REVIEW_HEAD_EXPECTATION" ]; then
  WORKFLOW_RESULT=INCOMPLETE
  WORKFLOW_REASON=pr-head-shift
fi
if [ -z "${WORKFLOW_REASON:-}" ]; then
  OWNER=$(jq -er '.base.repo.owner.login' <<< "$PR_JSON")
  REPO=$(jq -er '.base.repo.name' <<< "$PR_JSON")

  (cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && gh api graphql -f query='
    query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
      repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
        pullRequest(number: $pr) {
          reviewThreads(first: 100) {
            nodes { isResolved }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ' -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$REPO" -F pr="$PR_NUM") | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes | map(select(.isResolved == false)) | length'
fi
```

Pin completion checks to the exact published PR head:

```bash
if [ -z "${WORKFLOW_REASON:-}" ]; then
  CHECK_STATUS=0
  CHECKS_JSON=$(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && github_watch_pr_checks "$PR_NUM" "$PR_HEAD_SHA") || CHECK_STATUS=$?
  case "$CHECK_STATUS" in
    0) printf '%s\n' "$CHECKS_JSON" | jq '.' ;;
    1) echo "CI failed. Return to the fix cycle and do not claim completion." ;;
    2) WORKFLOW_RESULT=INCOMPLETE; WORKFLOW_REASON=checks-registration-timeout ;;
    3) WORKFLOW_RESULT=INCOMPLETE; WORKFLOW_REASON=checks-api-failure ;;
    4) WORKFLOW_RESULT=INCOMPLETE; WORKFLOW_REASON=pr-head-shift ;;
    *) WORKFLOW_RESULT=INCOMPLETE; WORKFLOW_REASON=checks-unknown-failure ;;
  esac
fi
```

For metadata failures, an `EXPECTED_REVIEW_HEAD` mismatch, statuses 2-4, or an
unknown status, follow **Hard Invariant Failure**. A registration timeout, API
failure, or PR head shift is never a successful CI result.

## Step 12: Watch for Bot Re-review

**Skip if `WATCH_MODE` is `false` or no review bots were detected.**

Read `watch-loop.md` for Phase Transition logic, bot polling, quiet period detection, timeout handling, and re-trigger procedures.

---

## Embedded Consumer Contract

When ship, e2e-verify, or another workflow executes Steps 2-11, return control
to the caller after Step 11 and emit no terminal marker. The caller remains the
top-level owner of its later verification, posting, merge, and completion
gates.

On the no-feedback path, return `REVIEW_CLEAN=true` and persist
`review_clean=true` to the caller's `STATE_FILE` when available. Embedded
consumers skip the inapplicable edit, commit, reply, resolution, and re-review
steps, but still execute Step 5 local verification, Step 7 CI, and Step 11
completion verification before regaining control.

---

## Completion Criteria

The standalone address-review owns its final marker only after Step 11 and all
applicable completion criteria pass. Embedded consumers follow the contract
above instead.

### With `--no-watch`:
Output `<done>COMPLETE</done>` when: branch rebased; local verification passes;
CI is green; Step 11 confirms no unresolved threads; and, when feedback was
found, all feedback is addressed, fixes are validated and pushed, replies are
posted, threads are resolved, and re-review is requested. A clean review skips
only those feedback-specific actions.

### Default (watch mode):
All above, PLUS all detected review bots signaled approval per `bot-registry.md`.

When all criteria are met:

```bash
if [ "$EMBEDDED_WORKFLOW" = "true" ]; then
  set_workflow_result "$STATE_FILE" "$WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH" "complete" "" "completed"
  echo "ADDRESS_REVIEW_RESULT=complete"
else
  set_loop_terminal_result "$STATE_FILE" "complete" "" "completed" "COMPLETE"
  echo "<done>COMPLETE</done>"
fi
```

If the user exits or skips a bot before all detected bots approve, follow the
**Incomplete Approval Outcome** procedure in `watch-loop.md`. Persist
`approval_result` and `approval_reason`; standalone address-review emits its
allowlisted `INCOMPLETE` marker while embedded address-review returns its
structured failure without a marker.

**Safety:** If 15+ iterations complete without success, document the blocking
evidence and stop incomplete. Do not bypass review or approval criteria.
