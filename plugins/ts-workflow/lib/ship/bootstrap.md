# Ship State Bootstrap

Loaded by `skills/ship/SKILL.md` during state setup. Execute this procedure before argument persistence or context discovery.

## 0. State File Bootstrap

Ship has exactly one state owner. A caller embeds ship by supplying both
`CALLER_LOOP_STATE_FILE` and `CALLER_WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH`; ship creates a child
object in that physical file and never initializes another loop. Without both
values, ship is standalone and always resolves the released canonical state
file under the original repository root. A valid legacy standalone file is
migrated in place by `read_loop_state`, preserving its root field names and
phase routing.

Released ship versions could write that standalone file under a linked
worktree. When the canonical primary-root file is absent, ship enumerates the
linked worktree's loop-state files and relocates the candidate only when exactly
one exists and it is valid ship state. It then migrates the schema and fills
only missing root locator fields from the current registered worktree. Multiple
linked candidates, invalid JSON, or state owned by another loop stop without
mutation and name every ambiguous path. An existing canonical state always
wins; linked-worktree strays are ignored in that case.
