# Coverage Verification (Shared Reference)

This document is referenced by both `$ts-workflow:ship` and `$ts-workflow:start-issue`. It's a router:
each step (A through F) gives the contract — what must be true on entry, what
must be true on return — and points to the sibling that owns the implementation.
Follow Steps A through F using the parameters provided by the calling command.

## Prerequisites

The calling command MUST set these variables before invoking this workflow:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BASE_BRANCH` | Branch to diff against | `origin/main` |
| `WORKTREE_PATH` | Absolute checkout path for every repository command | `/path/to/worktree` |
| `STATE_FILE` | **Absolute path** to the loop state JSON file | `/path/to/.local/state/owner.loop.local.json` |
| `WORKFLOW_STATE_PATH` | JSON array path for the calling workflow object | `[]` or `["components","ship"]` |
| `SKIP_COVERAGE` | Compatibility flag; may skip only source-free changes | `true` or `false` |
| `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` | Minimum coverage percentage for changed files | `60` |

**Worktree note:** `STATE_FILE` points into the original repo, while coverage
artifacts live under `$WORKTREE_PATH/.local/state/`. Every repository and
coverage command targets `WORKTREE_PATH` explicitly.

## State-file fields written

After this workflow returns, the resolved workflow object holds these keys
(callers read them to render summary lines):

| Field | Type | Set by | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| `coverage_result` | string | Step E.3 | Aggregate percent (e.g. `"82.4"`); empty when skipped |
| `coverage_skip_reason` | string | Step E.3 | Empty when a real number was computed; `"all-main"` when every changed file was `package main` |
| `coverage_tests_generated` | number | Step F | Count of new tests added (0 when Step F didn't run) |

**Caller contract:** When rendering a summary, check `coverage_skip_reason`
before formatting `coverage_result` with a percent sign. If `coverage_skip_reason`
is non-empty, render a textual reason (e.g. `skipped — all changed files are
package main`) instead of `<COV_RESULT>%`.

## Step A: Skip Conditions

Only source-free changes may skip this workflow. `SKIP_COVERAGE=true` does not
waive the gate when Step B finds changed source files. No driver may bypass
measurable changed-source coverage.

## Step B: Detect Changed Source Files

Detect committed/uncommitted/staged/untracked files and filter to source files
per detected project type. For Go, partition into **gated** files (count toward
the aggregate) and **info** files (`package main` — shown in the report but
excluded from the gate).

→ Read `step-b-detect-changed-files.md` for the full procedure: the
`CHANGED_FILES` collector, per-language source-file filters (Go / Node /
Rust / Python), the `get_pkg` comment-aware Go package extractor, and the
gated/info partitioning loop. The rationale for excluding `package main`
(issue #143) lives there.

If `CHANGED_SRC` is empty after filtering → skip (no source files to measure
coverage for). Return to the calling command's next step.

## Step C: Run Coverage

Run the coverage tool appropriate for the detected project type and store
output for analysis.

→ Read `step-c-run-coverage.md` for the per-language commands (Go's built-in
the Go coverage command; Node detection of vitest/jest/c8; Rust llvm-cov or
tarpaulin; Python pytest-cov or coverage.py). It also contains the rule for
when tool failure stops the workflow vs zero coverage proceeding to analysis.

If the coverage tool binary is genuinely missing (e.g., `cargo-llvm-cov` not
installed), stop incomplete with `WORKFLOW_REASON=coverage-tool-unavailable`.
Otherwise — even if coverage is 0% — proceed to Step D. **Do NOT treat low
coverage as a tool failure.**

## Step D: Analyze Changed-File Coverage

Parse the coverage output and compute per-file coverage for changed files only:

1. For each file in `CHANGED_SRC`, extract its line or function coverage percentage
2. Identify specific uncovered functions/methods in changed files
3. Calculate the aggregate coverage percentage across changed source files (Go: gated files only — `CHANGED_SRC_GATED`, excluding `package main`; other languages: all of `CHANGED_SRC`)

→ Read `step-d-analyze.md` for the full statement-weighted Go coverprofile
parser (two-pass: gated, then info), the `ALL_MAIN` flag logic, and the
per-language JSON parsing notes (Node coverage-summary.json, Rust
llvm-cov/tarpaulin JSON, Python coverage.json).

**Outputs from Step D** (used by Steps E and F):
- `AGGREGATE_COVERAGE` — percent string (or `"N/A"` when `ALL_MAIN=true`)
- `ALL_MAIN` — boolean: `true` when every changed file is `package main`
- `FILE_REPORT` — per-file table rows (gated rows have empty Notes;
  info rows carry `excluded from gate (package main)`)
- `UNCOVERED_FUNCS` — newline-separated `file:func1, func2` entries
  (Go-only, gated files only — see issue #143)
- `INFO_COUNT` — number of `package main` files included in the report

## Step E: Coverage Gate Decision

**MANDATORY RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS:** When coverage is below
`COVERAGE_THRESHOLD`, display the report, generate tests for the uncovered
changed-source behavior, and rerun the gate. If coverage still misses the
threshold, stop incomplete. No driver may skip, waive, rationalize, or proceed
with low coverage.

**Design philosophy: "if you touch it, you own it."** The entire file's
coverage counts, regardless of which lines you changed. The carve-out for
`package main` (Go only) is detected by the package clause and is the only
exception — see Step B and issue #143.

→ Read `step-e-gate.md` for the exact report formats (Go 4-column with the
`ALL_MAIN`-conditional footer; non-Go 3-column), the gate-decision tree (pass /
`ALL_MAIN` warning / coverage < threshold / no test files / tool failure), test
generation routing, and the jq blocks that persist success or incomplete
outcomes.

## Step F: Test Generation for Uncovered Code

When Step E routes here, generate tests for the uncovered functions identified
in Step D:

- **All uncovered functions** for below-threshold coverage
- **No-test-files path** when no test files exist anywhere; fall back to
  extracting exported signatures from `CHANGED_SRC` directly

After generation, rerun Steps C through E once. If the gate still fails, Step E
persists the incomplete reason and stops.

→ Read `step-f-test-generation.md` for: the `CHANGED_FUNC_NAMES` extraction
bash, per-language test-writing conventions (Go table-driven, vitest/jest,
Rust `#[test]`, pytest parametrize), and the `coverage_tests_generated`
state-file write at the end.
