# Start-Issue — Subagent-Orchestrated Workflow

Loaded by `skills/start-issue/SKILL.md` when `NO_AGENTS=false` (the default).
The orchestrator (the trunk's session) retains all control flow, verification
gates, and external interactions; subagents handle exploration,
implementation, and review.

## Subagent Model Policy

Each prompt under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/` declares its default `model`
frontmatter. Do not pass a per-dispatch model in this workflow unless the user
explicitly requests a one-off override; doing so would mask the prompt's model
policy.

When dispatching, always set `subagent_type` to the prompt file's frontmatter
`name` so Claude Code loads that custom subagent definition and applies its
model policy.

Defaults:

| Delegated prompt | Model policy | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| `explore-prompt.md` | `haiku` | Read-only codebase exploration |
| `implementer-prompt.md` | `inherit` | TDD implementation keeps the parent session's model |
| `spec-review-prompt.md` | `sonnet` | Mechanical requirements checklist |
| `quality-review-prompt.md` | `sonnet` | TypeScript/React idiom, complexity, security, and test review |

To override all subagent models for a run, set `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`
before invoking `$ts-workflow:start-issue` or `$ts-workflow:complete-issue`. To avoid subagents
entirely, pass `--no-agents`.

## Step 1: Check for Duplicates (Bug Fix Only)

If issue is a **bug**:

```bash
ISSUE_SEARCH_TERMS="$ISSUE_TITLE $ISSUE_BODY"
gh issue list --repo "$REPO_SLUG" --state all --limit 50 --search "$ISSUE_SEARCH_TERMS"
```

If potential duplicates are found, resolve a **driver-resolvable gate**:

- If an issue describes the same observable defect and already has an active
  implementation, stop duplicate implementation and link the issues with
  `WORKFLOW_REASON=duplicate-active-implementation`.
- If an issue is closed with a merged fix, verify whether the reported behavior
  still reproduces. Continue only for a verified regression; otherwise stop
  with `WORKFLOW_REASON=duplicate-already-resolved`.
- If the overlap is partial or the acceptance criteria differ, continue and
  link the related issue for context.

State `Decision`, `Evidence`, and `Rationale`. Do not request input merely
because search returned similar issues.

For either terminal duplicate outcome, set `WORKFLOW_REASON` to the supplied
reason and follow the start-issue **Workflow Result Contract**. Embedded
start-issue persists `result=incomplete`, the reason, and phase `incomplete` in
its component subtree and returns without changing or emitting the caller's
completion promise. Standalone start-issue switches its active completion
promise to allowlisted `INCOMPLETE` and emits `<done>INCOMPLETE</done>`. Stop
without an implementation or completion claim.

## Step 2: Create Branch (skip if worktree was created)

REQUIRED unless using a worktree. Never commit to main/master.

For bugs: `git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" checkout -b "fix/$ISSUE_NUM-<short-desc>"`
For features: `git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" checkout -b "feat/$ISSUE_NUM-<short-desc>"`

Verify: `git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" branch --show-current`

## Step 3: Explore Phase

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/explore-prompt.md` and fill in:

- `{ISSUE_TITLE}` — from issue context
- `{ISSUE_BODY}` — from issue context (body + comments)
- `{ISSUE_TYPE}` — "bug" or "feature"
- `{WORKTREE_PATH}` — absolute path to working directory
- `{REPO_CONVENTIONS}` — from CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md if present

Delegate through the active surface using the Explore prompt:

```
<filled explore-prompt template>
```

Store the results: `STACK`, `RELEVANT_FILES`, `PATTERNS`, `ROOT_CAUSE` (bugs) or `INTEGRATION_POINTS` (features), `PROPOSED_CHANGES`, `TASK_DECOMPOSITION`.

`STACK` reports the package manager (`$PM`), workspace layout, framework,
backend, and test runner. Reconcile it with the `$PM` detected in the trunk's
Context step and use it for every build, test, type-check, and lint command in
Steps 9 through 12.

## Step 4: Design Approach (Features Only)

Present the plan before implementing. Plan approval is the gate — once the user accepts the plan, you have approval for everything in it (including data migrations, schema changes, and new packages). Do not stop again to re-confirm individual items that were already in the approved plan.

Using the Explore results, propose 2-3 approaches with concrete trade-offs:

- What it changes (files, types, APIs, schema/migrations)
- Trade-offs (complexity vs simplicity, performance vs maintainability)
- Your recommendation and why

**Surface migrations and schema changes explicitly in the plan** so the user can see them and approve in one shot. Do not treat migrations as a separate hard gate.

**For trivial features** (single function, obvious implementation): state your plan and proceed unless the user objects.

**For non-trivial features** (new package, API changes, data model changes):
present approaches and recommend one. Choose and proceed when repository
patterns, requirements, reversibility, and risk identify a best approach; state
`Decision`, `Evidence`, and `Rationale`. If approaches produce materially
different product behavior and the issue does not specify which behavior is
correct, follow the shared **missing-intent gate** and stop before implementation.

## Step 5: Work Decomposition

Using the Explore results and approved approach:

**For bugs:** Typically 1 task — fix the root cause identified in the Explore phase.

**For features:** Decompose into N tasks where each task:

- Has a clear description of what to implement
- Lists `TARGET_FILES` (files to create/modify) — must be disjoint across tasks for parallel dispatch
- Lists `TEST_FILES`
- Lists `CONTEXT_FILES` (read-only reference files)
- Notes dependencies on other tasks (empty = independent)

**Parallel dispatch decision:** if ALL tasks have disjoint `TARGET_FILES` AND disjoint `TEST_FILES` (including shared test helpers, fixtures, and setup files in the same workspace package) and no dependencies, they can run in parallel. Otherwise, sequential. Two tasks touching the same module almost always share a `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` file, and two tasks in the same workspace package share its tsconfig — default to sequential for same-module or same-package tasks.

## Step 6: Implementation Phase

For each task, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/implementer-prompt.md` and fill in:

- `{TASK_DESCRIPTION}` — from task decomposition
- `{TARGET_FILES}` — files this agent may create/modify
- `{TEST_FILES}` — test file(s) for this task
- `{WORKTREE_PATH}` — absolute path to working directory
- `{PATTERNS}` — from Explore results, prefixed with the `STACK` section so the implementer knows the package manager, workspace layout, and test runner to invoke
- `{CONTEXT_FILES}` — read-only reference files
- `{ISSUE_TYPE}` — "bug" or "feature"

**Dispatch:**

- **Parallel** (independent tasks with disjoint files):
  ```
  Delegate each task with the filled implementer-prompt in parallel.
  Wait for all to complete. Collect results.
  ```
- **Sequential** (dependent tasks or overlapping files):
  ```
  Delegate each task in order with the filled implementer-prompt.
  ```

**Handle subagent status:**

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| DONE | Continue to next task or review phase |
| DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | Evaluate concerns — fix correctness issues before proceeding |
| NEEDS_CONTEXT | Supply the requested information, re-dispatch the implementer |
| BLOCKED | Inspect the requested context and available evidence. Supply technical context and re-dispatch when possible; if product intent or acceptance criteria are genuinely missing, follow the shared missing-intent gate; otherwise record the technical blocker and stop. |

## Step 7: Spec Compliance Review

After ALL implementation tasks complete:

```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" remote show origin 2>/dev/null | grep 'HEAD branch' | sed 's/.*: //' || echo "main")
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" diff "origin/${DEFAULT_BRANCH}...HEAD"
```

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/spec-review-prompt.md` and fill in:

- `{ISSUE_TITLE}`, `{ISSUE_BODY}`, `{ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA}` — from issue context
- `{WORKTREE_PATH}` — working directory
- `{CHANGED_FILES}` — list of all files changed
- `{DIFF}` — the full diff

Delegate the filled spec-review prompt through the active surface.

**If VERDICT = FAIL:** address missing requirements by re-dispatching implementer subagent(s) for the gaps. Re-run spec review (max 2 retry cycles).

**If VERDICT = PASS:** proceed to Step 8.

## Step 8: Code Quality Review

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/quality-review-prompt.md` and fill in `{WORKTREE_PATH}`, `{CHANGED_FILES}`, `{DIFF}`, `{PATTERNS}` (from Explore, prefixed with the `STACK` section), `{REPO_CONVENTIONS}` (from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md).

Delegate the filled quality-review prompt through the active surface.

**If HAS_FINDINGS:**

- Priority 0-1 (critical/high): fix these directly, then re-run quality review (max 1 retry)
- Priority 2-3 (medium/low): note in PR description but do not block

**If CLEAN:** proceed to Step 9.

## Step 9: Verify

Run the full verification checklist. **All must pass before proceeding:**

- **Codegen** (Convex repos only): `(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && npx convex codegen)` to refresh `convex/_generated/` before type-checking. Never hand-edit `convex/_generated/`.
- **Build**: `(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && $PM run build)` (if the `build` script exists)
- **Type-check**: `(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && $PM run type-check)` if the script exists, else `(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && npx tsc --noEmit)` when a `tsconfig.json` exists. This is the repo-wide check the implementers deliberately skipped.
- **All tests**: `(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && $PM run test)`, or the runner reported in `STACK` (`npx vitest run`, `npx jest`)
- **Lint**: `(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && $PM run lint)` (if the script exists)
- **Build logs**: if a dev server is running, check its log output for errors

In a monorepo (turbo/nx/pnpm workspaces), run the root scripts from the
repository root so the task runner fans out across workspaces; do not
verify only the package you happened to edit.

If any step fails, fix the issue and re-run until all green.

## Step 9.5: Coverage Verification

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/coverage/coverage-verification.md` and follow Steps A through F with:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `BASE_BRANCH` | `origin/${DEFAULT_BRANCH}` (compute if not already set: `git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" remote show origin 2>/dev/null \| grep 'HEAD branch' \| sed 's/.*: //' \|\| echo "main"`) |
| `STATE_FILE` | `$ORIGINAL_REPO_ROOT/.local/state/start-issue-$ISSUE_NUM.loop.local.json` |
| `WORKTREE_PATH` | absolute path persisted by the start-issue trunk |
| `SKIP_COVERAGE` | from parsed flags (default: `false`) |
| `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` | from parsed flags (default: `60`) |

Continue to Step 10 only after coverage passes or the shared gate determines
the diff has no gated source files.

## Step 10: Security Review

Before submitting, scan for security issues in changed files:

- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: `(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && $PM audit)` (skip if the package manager does not support it)
- **Scan changed files** for common JavaScript/TypeScript security issues:
  - Hardcoded secrets or credentials, and server-only secrets leaked into the client bundle through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` / `VITE_*` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env vars
  - Missing auth/authorization checks on server actions, API route handlers, and backend functions
  - SQL injection (template-string interpolation into queries instead of parameterized/prepared statements)
  - XSS (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML`, unsanitized user-supplied HTML or URLs)
  - Path traversal (`path.join` with user input and no containment check after `path.resolve`)
  - Unsafe `child_process.exec` / `eval` / dynamic `require` with unsanitized user input
  - Unvalidated request input crossing a trust boundary (missing zod parsing, or Convex args without `v.*` validators)
- **If changes touch auth, crypto, or data handling code**, suggest running `/codex review` with a security focus

## Step 11: Submit

1. Stage and commit with a conventional commit message referencing the issue
2. Push the branch: `git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" push -u origin <branch>`
3. **Check for PR template** — look in these locations (in order):
   - `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
   - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` (directory with multiple templates — apply the template-selection policy below)
   - `docs/pull_request_template.md`
   - `docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` (directory with multiple templates)
   - `pull_request_template.md` (repo root)
   - `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` (repo root directory with multiple templates)
4. **If template found**: read the template and use its exact section structure for the PR body. Fill in every section — do not omit or skip sections. Always include `Fixes #<issue-number>` or `Closes #<issue-number>` even if the template doesn't have a dedicated section for it.
5. **If no template found**, use this default:
   ```
   ## Summary
   <1-3 bullet points describing what changed and why>

   Fixes #<issue-number>

   ## Test Plan
   <How the changes were tested>
   ```
6. Create the PR with heredoc formatting:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --repo "$REPO_SLUG" --head "$(git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" branch --show-current)" --title "<type>(<scope>): <subject>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <filled-in template or default body>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

When multiple templates exist, resolve a **driver-resolvable gate**. Prefer an
explicit repository configuration or a template whose name and required
sections match the change type. Otherwise choose the general-purpose template,
or the first lexical template when all candidates are equally general. State
`Decision`, `Evidence`, and `Rationale`; do not request input.

## Step 12: Watch CI

After creating the PR, watch CI and fix any failures:

1. `gh pr checks "$PR_NUM" --repo "$REPO_SLUG" --watch`
2. **If "no checks reported"**: wait 10 seconds and retry, up to 3 times:
   ```bash
   for i in 1 2 3; do sleep 10 && gh pr checks "$PR_NUM" --repo "$REPO_SLUG" --watch && break; done
   ```
   If still no checks after retries, verify CI workflow files exist.
3. If checks fail:
   - Get failure details: `gh pr checks "$PR_NUM" --repo "$REPO_SLUG" --json name,state,description`
   - Analyze and fix the failing check
   - Commit and push the fix
   - Return to step 1
4. Continue only when all checks pass.
